# TrackML2DBaseline

This repository contains several baseline solutions for the TrackML mini challenge. In this challenge a 2D detector with circular geometry and uniform magnetic field is considered. The detector schema with hits and tracks of an event is shown in the figure below. The challenge is to recognize tracks of an event with the highest efficiecny. It supposed that one hit can belong to only one track.
